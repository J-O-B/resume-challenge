# Resume Tutorial
This resume forms part of the resume tutorial in Front End Development at Code Institute

### Description
Although this project was based around a resume, the goal in this mini project was to learn the principles of UX and design. Certain design and layout specifics
will be mentioned below. These examples will list reasons why certain dimensions, colors and effects were implemented.


## Purpose of Project
Create a resume.
Implement UX design principles, the importance of easily accessed information, as well as easy to use navigation (suited to this project).

## Percieved Use
As a new developer I plan on this project being used to convey my skills to a potential employer.
A user visiting this site is percieved to visit this site based on their needs for a new developer, this means perceived users will be recruiters,
HR staff etc. 

With this in mind I aimed to make this project according to percived user needs.


## Co-Occuring Colors 
To help the user experience, and try to create a sense of situational awareness within this website, I have implemented co-occuring colors. 

#### What do I mean by this?
Each navigation button has an associated color, this color is then re-used in the body of the corresponding page. This of course does not replace any
main form of navigation but is rather a design feature I implemented with the intention of giving a subtle hint to the user as to their location on the 
website.

An example of co-occuring colors can be seen below. In this picture you can see that the "Home" navigation button has a specific color, this color is then 
re-used on the left hand column within the body of the page.

## Re-Using Animation Styles
To help with consistency I have used the "rotate" CSS feature on hover for a number of items on the page. 

Among these are the icons in the navigation menu, the text in the personal information section, the social logos and the icons in the body section of the 
page. 

For all of these rotate animations, I used the same repetition of 20 degrees to try and create a recurring style, as well as increase user interaction.

To highlight text that I feel was important, I have used a transition to grow the specific section, to help draw a users attention to that specific section.

##### Thought behind animations?
I have chosen to include these animations as it adds user interaction. By including these features a user may be more interested to try and interact with 
specific areas of the pages. Being the designer, I have purposly included design features like this in areas that I want to draw attention to. These sections
include my social media links, 'reasons to hire me', personal details such as contact information, as well as website navigation.
