### Description
Although this project was based around a resume, the goal in this mini project was to learn the principles of UX and design. Certain design and layout specifics
will be mentioned below. These examples will list reasons why certain dimensions, colors and effects were implemented.


## Purpose of Project
Create a resume.
Implement UX design principles, the importance of easily accessed information, as well as easy to use navigation (suited to this project).

## Percieved Use
As a new developer I plan on this project being used to convey my skills to a potential employer.
A user visiting this site is percieved to visit this site based on their needs for a new developer, this means perceived users will be recruiters,
HR staff etc. 

With this in mind I aimed to make this project according to percived user needs.


## Co-Occuring Colors 
To help the user experience, and try to create a sense of situational awareness within this website, I have implemented co-occuring colors. 

#### What do I mean by this?
Each navigation button has an associated color, this color is then re-used in the body of the corresponding page. This of course does not replace any
main form of navigation but is rather a design feature I implemented with the intention of giving a subtle hint to the user as to their location on the 
website.

An example of co-occuring colors can be seen below. In this picture you can see that the "Home" navigation button has a specific color, this color is then 
re-used on the left hand column within the body of the page.

## Re-Using Animation Styles
To help with consistency I have used the "rotate" CSS feature on hover for a number of items on the page. 

Among these are the icons in the navigation menu, the text in the personal information section, the social logos and the icons in the body section of the 
page. 

For all of these rotate animations, I used the same repetition of 20 degrees to try and create a recurring style, as well as increase user interaction.

To highlight text that I feel was important, I have used a transition to grow the specific section, to help draw a users attention to that specific section.

##### Thought behind animations?
I have chosen to include these animations as it adds user interaction. By including these features a user may be more interested to try and interact with 
specific areas of the pages. Being the designer, I have purposly included design features like this in areas that I want to draw attention to. These sections
include my social media links, 'reasons to hire me', personal details such as contact information, as well as website navigation.

### Design Fundamentals
This resume was built with a mobile first approach, some examples of how this website looks on mobile can be seen below.

## Limitations
At this stage of my learning certain areas are incomplete due to lack of knowledge in that area. Some of these sections are:

1) Linking the contact form to an API,
2) Capability of displaying pdf document (resume.pdf) in the body area of its own page. 

Although these areas are not covered in this release, the information available on this site are sufficient to achieve the 
target goal. This is to convey skills to a potential employer. 

## Future Updates
I will come back to this project in the future and implement the above features to complete this project. 

## Technology Used
To create this project I relied on HTML & CSS.

This project uses Bootstrap CDN for its layout, FontAwesome icons and some color schemes. A direct import from Google fonts 
was used to import Exo 2 and Dosis fonts.

## Testing
To test this project I started with a mobile first design, testing the output on a mobile device and then added features 
as I progressed. This progressive testing finally lead me to [W3C Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) where I checked my 
HTML, as well as my CSS for language errors.

## Version
At this time there is no scope for future versions of this project. This is subject to change.

## Deployment:
To deploy this page to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:
1-Log into GitHub.
2-From the list of repositories on the screen, select "Resume-Challenge".
3-Once on the repository, select Settings from the options navigation bar close to the top of the page.
4-When in the "Sections" area, scroll down until you find the GitHub Pages section.
5-Under "Source" select the dropdown menu with placeholder text "none" and select "Master Branch"
6-Once you have selected "Master Branch" your page will automatically be refreshed.
7-After this refresh occurs, scroll down through the settings page again. Now there should be a link in the "GitHub Pages" section.
8-Click on this link to open the Resume Challenge file.

based on design principles promoted during this course.
